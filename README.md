# Tic-Tac-Toe-Best-of-5
This repository contains a Tic Tac Toe game with a twistâ€”a best-of-5 format that introduces a tiebreaker if both players are tied after 5 games. The game keeps track of player scores, highlights the current leader, and provides an engaging user experience.

## Overview
This project is a modern take on the classic Tic Tac Toe game, featuring a best-of-5 series format with a built-in tiebreaker to determine the ultimate winner. The application keeps track of player scores, updates the leaderboard dynamically, and provides a smooth, visually appealing gameplay experience. Each game is followed by a modal displaying the winner and a "Next Game" button to progress to the following game, ensuring a seamless flow through the series.
